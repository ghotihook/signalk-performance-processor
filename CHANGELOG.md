# Changelog

## 0.0.1 — 2026-10-29

First release, a proof of concept. Run it in Shadow mode alongside your instruments before relying on it.

- Corrections, each with an on/off switch: boat speed (linearity by speed plus heel correction), leeway (K × heel ÷ STW²), and H5000-style TWA and TWS tables with upwind, reach and downwind rows by TWS.
- True wind from apparent wind minus boat velocity including leeway; TWD from heading and variation; current from SOG/COG.
- Shadow mode publishes `…Corrected` paths; Replace mode publishes the standard paths under the plugin's own source for Source Priorities.
- Webapp with Live, Calibration and Settings pages. Configuration is saved as the plugin's options and validated before it is applied.
- Ships with this boat's defaults: the owner's STW table and leeway K, and TWA/TWS tables fitted to the 2025 race logs.
- Loop guard, input plausibility checks, a choice of source per input, and a test suite.
